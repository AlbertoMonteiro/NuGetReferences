NuGet References
===============

Extends Visual Studio solution explorer to expand the packages.config node and show installed packages:

Properties of the selected NuGet package are also displayed in the properties window:

And update/uninstall can be performed right from the node in the Solution Explorer window:

If you think this functionality is worth inviting me a small Stella Artois beer, please consider getting the  extension from the [DevStore](http://devstore.com) (you can also purchase it from Visual Studio itself, as explained [on my blog](http://kzu.to/10ZWFDJ)). 

For convenience purposes, I'm also offering a [pre-built VSIX](http://danielkzu.github.io/NuGetReferences/) here so you don't have to pay for it if you don't want to build it yourself. I am bundling the DevStore client bits with it, so that you can still consider exploring it for other cool extensions available through it ;). 

Of course, if neither option is suitable to you, you can always get the source and build it yourself ;), this is open source after all, you know?
