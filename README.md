![Icon](https://raw.github.com/danielkzu/NuGetReferences/master/NuGetReferences/Resources/Extension.png) NuGet References
===============

Extends Visual Studio solution explorer to expand the packages.config node and show installed packages:

![NuGet packages in Solution Explorer](https://raw.github.com/danielkzu/NuGetReferences/master/Images/Nodes.png)

Search directly from the Solution Explorer to find nuget packages used across a solution:

![Search NuGet packages in Solution Explorer](https://raw.github.com/danielkzu/NuGetReferences/master/Images/Search.png)

Properties of the selected NuGet package are also displayed in the properties window:

And update/uninstall can be performed right from the node in the Solution Explorer window:

For your convenience and my continued development and support for this extension, please consider purchasing it from the [DevStore](http://kzu.to/187bMy8 "NuGet References at DevStore") (you can also purchase it from Visual Studio itself, as explained [on this post](http://kzu.to/1aa2E8J)).

Alternatively, you can get the source code and build it yourself. You will need the Visual Studio SDK.
