![Icon](https://raw.github.com/danielkzu/NuGetReferences/master/NuGetReferences/Resources/Extension.png) NuGet References
===============

Extends Visual Studio solution explorer to expand the packages.config node and show installed packages:

Properties of the selected NuGet package are also displayed in the properties window:

And update/uninstall can be performed right from the node in the Solution Explorer window:

For your convenience and my continued development and support for this extension, please consider purchasing it from the [DevStore](http://www.devstore.com/Products/Details/bf17403a-48bf-432e-a102-b7be22648cee? "NuGet References at DevStore") (you can also purchase it from Visual Studio itself, as explained [on this post](http://kzu.to/1aa2E8J)).

Alternatively, you can get the source code and build it yourself. You will need the Visual Studio SDK.
